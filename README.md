# Retinal Vessel Segmentation using R2U-Net and Attention R2U-Net 

The morphological attributes of retinal vessels, such as length, width, tortuosity and branching pattern and angles, play an important role in diagnosis, screening, treatment, and evaluation of various cardiovascular and ophthalmologic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and arteriosclerosis. The crucial step before extracting these morphological characteristics of retinal vessels from retinal fundus images is vessel segmentation. In this work, we propose a method for retinal vessel segmentation based on fully convolutional networks. Thousands of patches are extracted from each retinal image and then fed into the network, and data argumentation is applied by rotating extracted patches. Two architectures of fully convolutional networks, R2U-Net and AttR2U-Net, are used for vessel segmentation.

## Method
### Preprocessing
* Gray-scale conversion
* Standardization
* Contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE)
* Gamma adjustment

### Patch Extraction and Data Augmentation
During training, 2000 patches with size 48 × 48 are randomly extracted from each image. Besides patch extraction, each extracted patch was rotated by 90◦, 180◦ and 270◦, thus the training set is quadrupled, i.e. 8000 patches are extracted from each image after data augmentation. At the end, all the patches, including original extracted and generated by rotation, are randomly shuffled and then fed into the network together with their corresponding ground truth segmentation mask patches.

During testing, images are cut into patches with size 48 × 48 and fed into the network for inference. The images are cut into patches by using a stride of N pixels (e.g. N = 5 or 10) in both height and width, so that one pixel can be predicted for multiply times. The final inference result is obtained by averaging multiple predictions.

* h5py ==3.9.0
* scikit-learn == 1.3.0
* tensorflow ==2.13.0

### Download and Prepare the Dataset

Download the Stare dataset from `https://cecas.clemson.edu/~ahoover/stare/` and place it in a new folder `STARE`.

Run the script `prepare_datasets_STARE.py` to prepare dataset and store in `STARE_datasets_training_testing` hdf5 format.
